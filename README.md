## Abstract
This repository contains the research project titled "Accepting Unsatisfactory Internship Offers Under Pressure Factors. A Model-based Exploration of the Consequences on Italian Students." The study examines how compulsory internships and low-quality offers affect Italian students' motivation, satisfaction, and retention in the workplace.
Internships are widely seen as gateways to the job market, but many students face the dilemma of accepting unsatisfactory offers. This paper builds a model to analyze key factors such as monetary compensation, skills acquisition, future signaling, and the pressure to complete compulsory internships.

## Key Findings
- A significant portion of internships (50.51%) is accepted under high pressure or compulsion.
- Monetary compensation doesn't strongly impact motivation but does influence retention.
- Skills acquired (RSA) are a stronger driver for motivation and satisfaction than monetary factors.
- STEM and Economics students are more affected by monetary factors than students from other fields.
- Policy suggestions include ensuring quality internship experiences and instituting minimum compensation to reduce distortions in the job market.
